Hi I'm Lukas.\
I'm a computer science student, here are mostly private projects or stuff I do for studies.\
Weird commits, branches or issues, are mainly the result of me, trying to teach my friends how to use git.\
Most people have the same questions, so in some repos, I create a dev branch, features branches, issues, etc. in order to show them the real life value of versioning.\
Then we usually go through 1 or 2 commits (git add . and git add file.type), git commit, git push and a pull request.\
This is basically my private sandbox, since most repositories, are outdated and can be subject to minimal changes, without bigger repercussions.

Pinned are \
nutrimate2 - an App I am currently working on (feel free to help, I will add you as a contributor)\
AP1 - For University, its 1st semester code stuff, intended to help students\
My Readme - no reason, other than 4 looks better than 3\
Adventofcode - a reminder to try harder this year
